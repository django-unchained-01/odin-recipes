    <h1>Description</h1>

        from various ingredients</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h3>Couscous:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of couscous grains</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups of water or broth</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stew:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of lamb, chicken, or beef (cut into pieces)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>3-4 medium carrots (cut into chunks)</li>
        <li>2-3 potatoes (cut into chunks)</li>
        <li>2 zucchinis (sliced)</li>
        <li>2-3 ripe tomatoes (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 cup of cooked chickpeas</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of harissa (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of turmeric</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups of water or broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic,
            and saut√© until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the meat (lamb, chicken, or beef) to the pot and brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the harissa, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Cook for a couple of
            minutes to release the spices' flavors.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and zucchini to the pot. Pour in the water or broth, and bring
            to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat, cover, and let the stew simmer for about 45 minutes, or until the meat and vegetables are
            tender.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the couscous. Place the couscous grains in a large bowl and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of
            olive oil. Mix well to coat the grains.</li>
        <li>Bring 2 cups of water or broth to a boil. Pour the boiling liquid over the couscous, cover the bowl, and let
            it sit for about 5 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Fluff the couscous with a fork to separate the grains. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Once the stew is ready, add the cooked chickpeas and let them heat through for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, place the couscous on a large platter. Create a well in the center and ladle the stew over the
            couscous. Garnish with chopped fresh herbs and serve with extra harissa on the side.</li>
    </ol>
